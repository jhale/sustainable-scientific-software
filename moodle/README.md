Dear all,

Looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday.

The course website is here: 

https://jhale.github.io/sustainable-scientific-software/

I particularly draw your attention to: You must bring a laptop with working WiFi access.

This must be a proper computer, not a tablet or smartphone.

Best regards,

Dr. Jack S. Hale

Dear all,

The notes for the course so far are at:

https://jhale.github.io/sustainable-scientific-software/

https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ - up to and including 6.

https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/ - we will eventually cover all,
although the latter chapters in less depth.

If you do not have git and GitHub setup properly (push existing repository to
GitHub) then please email me well in advance of next weeks lesson for support.

Looking ahead it would be good if you could install Docker Desktop:

Best regards,

Dr. Jack S. Hale

Dear all,

Here are my instructor notes (i.e. they are not complete, and I am
skipping/modifying some aspects during class) and some 'cheatsheets' with a
summary of the main commands.

Dear all,

Coursework 2 is here with a deadline of *insert*.

https://jhale.github.io/sustainable-scientific-software/courseworks/coursework2/coursework2.html

Coursework 1 is here with a deadline of *insert*.

For help please post in this thread, or the other for Coursework 1.

Other matters:

I have escalated the HPC course issue.

`rev` is not available in Git for Windows shell (it is a very minimal Unix-like
system). On Windows best to install e.g. Ubuntu via Windows Subsystem for Linux
which will give you a full feature set. If this isn't possible, don't worry,
this isn't critical and you can just write rev in where you think it is
necessary.
