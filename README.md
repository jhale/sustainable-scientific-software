### Useful informatiom.

* You must bring a laptop with working WiFi access.

* We will use [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/sss2025), a live
  collaborative note taking application. Etherpad is public, please use a

### Prerequisites

Students must know Python and have basic knowledge of a Unix shell, e.g. bash.

### Assessment

Three courseworks will be distributed during the course. To pass the course and
receive the ECTS credits you must complete the coursework. The marking schedule
will be explained with each piece of coursework.

### Retake policy

This course is assessed on the basis of two courseworks and attendance at the
practicals on Fridays (mandatory, subject to the UL study regulations).

In case of sufficient attendance and failure of the courseworks, you can
resubmit the assessment/coursework during the following semester.

In case of insufficient attendance, you must retake the entire course when it
is offered within the usual study programme (typically, in the Spring/Summer
semester).
