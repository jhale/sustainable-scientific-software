### Exercise 1: Basic Scripting Concepts

#### Objective:
Demonstrate understanding of basic Unix shell scripting concepts such as variables, loops, and conditionals.

#### Task:
Write a shell script that performs the following tasks:
1. Accepts a user's name as input.
2. Greets the user with a personalized message.
3. Displays the current date and time.

#### Deliverables:
- Shell script file (`greet_user.sh`) containing the implementation.
- README file explaining the script's functionality and usage instructions.

### Exercise 2: File Management Automation

#### Objective:
Automate basic file management tasks using shell scripting.

#### Task:
Write a shell script that automates file backup:

### Exercise 3: Integration with System Utilities

#### Objective:
Integrate shell scripts with system utilities to perform basic system monitoring.

#### Task:
Write a shell script that monitors system resource usage using `df` and `free` commands:
1. Executes the `df` command to display disk space usage.
2. Executes the `free` command to display memory usage.
3. Logs the information to a file for future reference.

#### Deliverables:
- Shell script file (`system_monitor.sh`) containing the implementation.
- README file explaining the script's functionality and usage instructions.

### Exercise 4: Script Optimization

#### Objective:
Optimize shell scripts to improve performance and efficiency.

#### Task:
Optimize the `backup_files.sh` script from Exercise 2:
1. Refactor the script to improve code readability.
2. Implement error handling to ensure smooth execution.
3. Provide feedback to the user during the backup process.

#### Deliverables:
- Optimized version of `backup_files.sh` script.
- README file explaining the script's functionality and usage instructions.

### Exercise 5: Real-world Simulation

#### Objective:
Apply shell scripting skills to solve a real-world problem scenario.

#### Task:
Simulate a scenario where log files need to be managed:
1. Write a shell script that searches for log files older than a specified number of days.
2. Archives the old log files to a separate directory.
3. Generates a report indicating the number of log files archived.

#### Deliverables:
- Shell script file (`manage_logs.sh`) containing the implementation.
- README file explaining the script's functionality and usage instructions.

### Exercise 6: Text Processing and Manipulation

#### Objective:
Demonstrate proficiency in text processing and manipulation using shell scripting.

#### Task:
Write a shell script that performs the following tasks:
1. Accepts a text file as input.
2. Counts the total number of words in the file.
3. Removes all occurrences of a specified word from the file.
4. Displays the modified content and the word count after removal.

#### Deliverables:
- Shell script file (`text_processing.sh`) containing the implementation.
- README file explaining the script's functionality and usage instructions.

### Exercise 7: System Monitoring and Alerting

#### Objective:
Develop a shell script for system monitoring and alerting.

#### Task:
Write a shell script that monitors CPU usage:
1. Checks the current CPU usage.
2. Compares it with a predefined threshold.
3. Sends an email alert if the CPU usage exceeds the threshold.
4. Logs the alert with timestamp for future reference.

#### Deliverables:
- Shell script file (`cpu_monitor.sh`) containing the implementation.
- README file explaining the script's functionality and usage instructions.
